# 🏙️ Empire State Building Walk Simulation  

This project is a **Jupyter Notebook-based** simulation that models a **random walk** up the Empire State Building using **NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib**.  

## 📌 Features  
- Simulates a **random walk** with probabilistic movement  
- Uses **NumPy** for random number generation  
- Utilizes **Pandas** for data analysis and manipulation  
- Visualizes results with **Matplotlib** (histograms, line plots, etc.)  
- Computes the probability of reaching at least a certain step height  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- NumPy – for numerical computations  
- Pandas – for data handling  
- Matplotlib – for visualization  

## 📥 Installation  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone  https://github.com/MinhQuan0716/PythonLearn.git
   cd PythonLearn
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter
   ```
3. Start Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open `PredictWalk.ipynb` in Jupyter.

## ▶️ Usage  
Run the Jupyter Notebook cell by cell to:  
1. Simulate a **random walk** based on probability.  
2. Generate a **histogram** of final step positions.  
3. Compute and display the **chance of reaching at least 60 steps**.  

## 📈 Example Output  
- Histogram of final positions 📊  
- Line plots showing walk trajectories 📉  
- Probability of reaching a certain height 🎯
